# About me

My name is Jakub. I'm a software engineer living in Berlin. I'm currently working at SumUp, as Android Engineer.

I spend most of my free time running around beautiful Tiergarten, trying to gather more knowledge about training plans, watching a review of yet another Super Shoe, or foam rolling (I wish ü•≤).

My personal bests:
- 10K:              00:37:21 ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Half-marathon:    01:23:51 ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Marathon:         02:56:12 ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Ironman 70:3:     05:36:31 ‚ö°Ô∏è

I consider myself a coffee lover or even an aspiring barista but I'm still struggling with the ideal latte art on my Flat White.
